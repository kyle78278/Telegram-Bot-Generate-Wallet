using replit for dev environment so you will need to do something to convert the pyproject.toml to -requirements.txt 
and do a pip install for dependancies. Im noob so I don't know what you need to do to get it to work. 

Also you will need the following:
- Telegram bot key
- etherscan api key
- RPC API provider like infura or alchemy 

todo: 
- USDT withdrawls
- clean up bot logic and flow
- multi wallet support
- better interface for wallets and balance
- error handling for things like if a user tries to request too many wallets
- wallet limit
- better safe keeping practices for private key storage
- dydx connections
- dydx trade executions
- open positions csv
- triggers
